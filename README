Ruby and Rails bash functions for application development
=========================================================

This is a library of console scripts that I have developed as needed to facilitate working 
with Ruby & Rails development, using Hobo, Textmate, Heroku, Git, MySql etc.
Feel free to fork and provide your own additions or suggest more utility scripts. 
There may also be some bugs here and there for functions I rarely use...
